# TODO
- multithreaded example generation
  - [ ] chain multiple generators together (write into files whose names are randomly generated)
  - [ ] write to tar files, then merge the tar files
  - [x] load examples from multiple files (chain together into a single iterable)
- training larger models on more data
  - [ ] generate 1m examples with no randomness (no z's)
  - [x] start training large model on 100k, 1m examplees
- housekeeping/optimization
  - [ ] change rect representation to two corners
  - [ ] adjust tensorboard writer global step: batch no, not epoch
  - [x] compute per-seq loss instead of per-tok loss
- overfitting
  - [ ] try reducing model size to 512 or 1024
  - [ ] look into regularization methods
  - [ ] try a different architecture (RNN: GRU instead of LSTM)
  - 
- discriminator
  - [ ] generate training data for discriminator
    - sets of bitmaps: ((B_1, B_2), [01])
    - class 0 if bitmaps drawn from different programs; class 1 if bitmaps drawn from the same program
